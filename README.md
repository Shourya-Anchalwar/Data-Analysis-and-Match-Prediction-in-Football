Sports are a major source of entertainment and commerce, with professional leagues and franchises generating billions of dollars in revenue each year, 
followed closely by millions around the world.

As one of the most popular sports on the planet, football has always been followed very closely by a large number of people. 
The massive amounts of data generated during football games provide an opportunity to gain insights into player and team performances, as well as trends in the sport.

We created a web application with core concept as analysis of a football match's parameters and the players playing the premier league. 
It enables users to view match predictions made through the algorithm based on previous records of the teams as well as view multiple different statistics related to the match.
It also allows user to access an intuitive dashboard to view in depth statistics of each and every team as well as player.
